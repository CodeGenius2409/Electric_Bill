# Electric_Bill
This C program calculates an electricity bill based on units consumed. It charges ₹0.80 per unit for the first 200 units, ₹0.90 for the next 100, and ₹1.00 for units beyond 300. If the total exceeds ₹400, a 15% tax and a ₹100 meter charge are added, displaying the final bill with all charges and taxes.
